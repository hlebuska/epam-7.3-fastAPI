AI Assistant Report

1) Tool Used and Interaction Modes
- Primary tool used: Codex (GPT-Codex-5.3 coding agent in terminal/IDE workflow).
- Interaction modes used:
  - Prompted review mode: asked AI to audit SQL injection risk, performance for 10k+ records, error handling, and edge cases.
  - Guided implementation mode: instructed AI to fix only medium-priority findings.
  - Documentation generation mode: requested API documentation with request/response examples.

2) AI Contribution Percentage
- Estimated AI contribution: around 75%
- Estimated manual contribution: 25%
- Rationale:
  - AI generated most of the technical changes, code edits, and draft documentation structure.
  - Manual work focused on scoping decisions, validating priority, fixing environment related issues, and correcting final behavior expectations.

3) Metrics
- Suggestions shown by AI: 7 review findings (with severity and file/line references).
- Suggestions accepted/implemented: 3 medium-priority items (100% of medium items accepted).
- Suggestions intentionally not implemented: low/low-medium items (e.g., float-to-decimal refactor, timezone policy redesign).
- Test execution:
  - First run failed due to missing PATH pytest command.
  - Follow-up run via virtual environment succeeded.
  - Final result after fixes: 30/30 tests passing.
- Time estimate:
  - With AI: ~70 minutes (review, targeted fixes, docs generation, validation).
  - Without AI: ~2.5 to 3 hours (manual code audit, implementation, test/debug, docs writing).
  - Estimated time saved: ~65-70%.

4) AI-Generated vs Manually Added/Corrected
AI-generated:
- Initial risk review with prioritized findings.
- DB exception handling structure in CRUD and API layers.
- One-query list strategy using window count.
- Index additions in model metadata.
- API documentation draft with request/response examples.

Manually added/corrected:
- Defined scopes for endpoint limits
- Manaully installed linter (ruff) due to Codex's giving out incorrect installation 
- Behavioral correction for out-of-range pagination total (fallback count path requirement).
- Implemntation details duting planning
- Final acceptance criteria and quality gate: all tests must pass after changes.
- Documentation fixes.
