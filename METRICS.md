# GitHub Copilot Metrics Report

## Project
Orders Management API (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite) with pagination, filtering, seeding, tests, and documentation.

## Copilot Contribution Percentage
Estimated Copilot contribution: around **70%**.

How this was estimated:
- Copilot-generated scaffolding and boilerplate for API layers, schema/model structure, and test skeletons made up most of initial code volume.
- Manual effort focused on validation corrections, framework deprecations, environment/path fixes, and test reliability improvements.

## Acceptance Rate (Suggestions Shown vs Accepted)
- Acceptance rate: roughly **85%** (effective prompting helped to increase accepance rate)

- Acceptance rate was higher during repetitive tasks (CRUD/test templates).
- Acceptance rate dropped when suggestions involved environment assumptions or outdated library patterns.

## Estimated Time Saved
Estimated time saved: **3.5 to 5 hours** 

Where time was saved most:
- Initial endpoint and schema scaffolding
- Repetitive filtering and pagination test generation
- Generating tests
- README + METRICS drafting

## What Was Generated vs Manually Fixed
### Mostly generated by Copilot
- FastAPI route scaffolding (`POST /orders`, `GET /orders`)
- SQLAlchemy CRUD query structure using `select()`
- Pydantic schema skeletons
- Large portion of test cases for pagination/filter behavior
- README baseline sections and usage examples

### Manually fixed/refined
- Replaced deprecated FastAPI startup hook usage (`on_event`) with lifespan handlers
- Corrected deprecated datetime usage (`utcnow`) in code/tests
- Fixed setup assumptions where generated commands targeted the wrong environment/path
- Corrected test database isolation and dependency override behavior
- Tightened validation and enum handling to match expected test outcomes
- Cleaned and adjusted generated tests to remove brittle assertions and import issues

## 3 Key Learnings (Where Copilot Helped vs Struggled)
1. Copilot works great with repetetive/simple patterns that does not depend on other code (writing simple tests, generating schemas, models boilerplate)

2. Copilot can suggest outdated and deprecated patterns. Some suggestions used deprecated framework/library methods. Verification needed, possible solution: using MCP such as context7 for up to date documentations

3. Generated setup commands sometimes assumed incorrect working directories or virtualenv paths, so environment-aware corrections were required.
